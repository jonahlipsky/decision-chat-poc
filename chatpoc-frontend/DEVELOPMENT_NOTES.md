# Development Notes

## 25 December 2023
I think that the next step is to consider creating a free text page.
Then there are plenty of options as far as how I want to package this.
Also the style of the text box and submit button need to improve.
Also the color scheme of the chat, although this could be run by the more artistically minded. It might be more of a text bubble rather than raw text that have different colors.
