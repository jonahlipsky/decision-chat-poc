"Hmm, that sounds like a tough decision. Before we dive in, can you tell me a bit more about your sense of purpose and why you're considering making a change? What are your goals and values that are driving this decision?\n\nWell, I've always been driven by a desire to make a lot of money and have financial security. I feel like I've been making good progress towards that goal at my current job, but I could potentially make even more at another company. But at the same time, I really enjoy the work I'm doing now and I feel like I'm making a meaningful contribution to the company. So, I'm not sure if I should prioritize financial gain over job satisfaction.\n\nThat's a really tough decision! It sounds like you're weighing the potential gains and losses of each option. Can you tell me more about what you might stand to gain or lose by making a change? How might this decision align with your sense of purpose and values?\n\nSure. If I were to switch jobs, I could potentially make more money and have more financial security, which is a big part of my sense of purpose. But I might also have to sacrifice some of the job satisfaction and meaningful work that I currently have. On the other hand, if I stay at my current job, I'll continue to have a sense of purpose and fulfillment, but I might miss out on the potential financial gains.\n\nIt sounds like you're considering both the potential gains and losses of each option, which is a great way to approach this decision. Can you tell me more about how deeply felt your sense of purpose is? How important is it to you that you make a decision that aligns with your values and goals?\n\nMy sense of purpose is pretty deeply felt. I've always been driven by the desire to make a lot of money and have financial security, and I feel like this decision will have a big impact on my ability to achieve that goal. So, it's important to me that I make a decision that aligns with my values and goals, rather than just choosing the option that might be more financially lucrative."
