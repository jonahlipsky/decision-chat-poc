" It sounds like you're facing a difficult decision between staying in your current role that is going well, or pursuing a new opportunity that may offer more compensation. \n\nWhen weighing these options, it's important to consider your reference point - how satisfied are you currently with your job and salary? The potential uncertainties and risks of leaving for a new role versus the potential gains in compensation and other benefits also need to be weighed. \n\nOn the other hand, relating this decision back to your broader sense of purpose can provide an important lens. How deeply felt is your purpose at work? Does staying align better or worse with your values and what gives you meaning? There is no universally right or wrong choice - it depends on how these pros and cons align with your personal goals and purpose. \n\nRather than telling you what is rational, I encourage you to reflect on how deeply your current role fulfills you, what risks change might bring, and how a new job would or would not serve your sense of purpose. The right choice depends on your unique situation and what matters most to you. My role is not to say what is best, but to help you carefully weigh these tradeoffs as they relate to your values and purpose. Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on anything as you think this through."
